The following resources will be provisioned:

- Azure Virtual Networks with VNet Peering
  - Hub and spoke network in Azure
  - Simulated on-premises network in Azure
- Simulated on-premises environment
  - Azure Virtual Machine with Hyper-V hosting a simulated on-premises Windows server machine
  - Azure Virtual Machine hosting SQL Server to simulate an on-premises SQL database server
- Azure Bastion to enable secure Remote Desktop connections to Virtual Machines

## Notes

- This folder contains both an ARM Template (`deploy.json`) file and Azure Bicep (`deploy.bicep`) file for automating the deployment of the Before the Hands-on Lab (HOL) resources necessary for the Hands-on lab.

- When authoring these scripts the infrastructure deployment was authored in Azure Bicep first within the `deploy.bicep` file, and then the Azure Bicep CLI `./bicep build` command was used to build the matching ARM Template.
