# Task 03 - Create existing resources

## Introduction

Tailspin Toys wants to migrate its SQL Server database and Web Application to Azure. In this task, we will create a simulated on-prem environment in Azure by deploying several resources using the provided ARM Template.

## Description

In this task, you will leverage a custom Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to deploy the existing Azure resources and a simulated on-premises environment for Tailspin Toys.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Deploy the [ARM Template](https://github.com/vraposo/TechExcel-Securely-migrate-Windows-Server-and-SQL-Server-workloads-to-Azure/tree/main/Hands-on%20lab/resources/deployment) to Azure.
2. Confirm that all resources have been deployed.

## Success Criteria

* You have deployed all necessary Azure resources.

## Solution

<summary>Expand this section to view the solution</summary>

1. Open a browser using "InPrivate" or "Incognito" mode, and navigate to the ARM template: [ARM Template on GitHub](https://github.com/vraposo/TechExcel-Securely-migrate-Windows-Server-and-SQL-Server-workloads-to-Azure/tree/main/Hands-on%20lab/resources/deployment).

    {: .highlight }
    > If you're deploying to Azure Gov, open a browser with your corporate account profile loaded in it instead of one in "InPrivate" or "Incognito" mode.

2. Select **Deploy to Azure**. This will open a new browser tab to the Azure Portal for custom deployments.

3. If prompted, sign in with an account that is an owner of the Azure Subscription.

4. Fill in the required ARM template parameters.

    - Create a new **Resource group**.
    - Set **Region** to `North Central US`.
    - Set **Deployment Location** to an Azure region where you have quota to deploy the needed resources.

    {: .highlight }
    You can run the following Azure CLI to get a list of Azure Regions `az account list-locations -o table`.

    - Set **Azure Ad User Id** to the Azure AD `id` of the user that was previously copied from the Azure CLI.
    - Set **Azure Ad User Login** to the Azure AD `userPrincipalName` that was previously copied from the Azure CLI.
    - Set **Onprem VM Size** to a VM size that you have quota for.

    {: .highlight }
    You can run the following Azure CLI to get a list of SKUs usage in a specific Azure Region `az vm list-usage -l <location> -o table`.

    - Set **Sqlmi Sku** to `GP_Gen5`. This will deploy a *General Purpose - Generation 5* SQL Managed Instance.
    - Set **Sqlmi V Cores** to `8`. This will deploy a *8 VCores* SQL Managed Instance.
    - Select **Review + create**.

    ![Azure Portal Create a new deployment standard window with entries to add all options needed to deploy the ARM template.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/CustomDeployment-laststep.png "Fill in the required ARM template parameters")

5. Agree to the Terms and conditions and select **Create**.

    {: .highlight }
    The deployment is now underway. On average, this process can take anywhere between 2 to 4 hours to complete. It is important that you monitor the deployment progress to ensure there are no problems. You can monitor progress by selecting the notification bell in the upper right corner and selecting **Deployment in progress...**

{: .note }
> While automation can make things simpler and repeatable, sometimes it can fail. If at any time during the ARM template deployment there is a failure, review the failure, delete the Resource Group, and try the ARM template again, adjusting for errors.

Once the ARM template is deployed, the status will change to complete. At this point, things are ready for you to go through the Hands-on lab.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
