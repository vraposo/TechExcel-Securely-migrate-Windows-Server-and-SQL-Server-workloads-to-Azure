1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    {: .highlight }
    > If you're using Azure Gov, sign in to the [Azure Gov Portal](https://portal.azure.us).

2. At the top of the Azure Portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon.

3. In the **Cloud Shell**, run the following Azure CLI command. This will retrieve the Entra ID information for your login.

    ```bash
    az ad signed-in-user show
    ```

4. Copy the **id** and **userPrincipalName** values from the returned output from the Azure CLI command and save it for use later.

    > The ARM Template will use this user Id and Name as the Administrator for the Azure SQL Managed Instance resource. This user must be an Entra ID user and cannot be a personal Microsoft Account.
    > If you need to, look up an alternative user to use for this, then run the following command instead:
    > 
    > ```bash
    > az ad user show --id <azure-login>
    > ```
    >
    > Replace the `<azure-login>` placeholder with the user's email login. Ex: `user@domain.onmicrosoft.com`
