# Task 01 - Create Windows Server 2022 Azure Edition VM for application hosting

## Introduction

Tailspin Toys wants to migrate their on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance. In this task, you will create a new Azure Virtual Machine to host the migrated Web Application.

## Description

In this task, you will create a new Windows Server 2022: Azure Edition virtual machine (VM) that will be the destination for migrating the on-premises Web Application to Azure.

The key tasks are as follows:
1. Create a new Azure Virtual Machine using the **Windows Server 2022: Azure Edition** image.

## Success Criteria

* Create a new Azure Virtual Machine to host the Web Application.

## Solution

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that you're using a subscription associated with the same resources you created during the Before the hands-on lab set up.

2. On the **Home** page within the Azure Portal, towards the top, select **Create a resource**.

    ![The Home page of the Azure Portal is shown with the 'Create a resource' link highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-home-create-resource-link.png "Create a resource on Azure Portal Home page")

3. Within the **Search services and marketplace** field, type **Windows Server** and press Enter to search the marketplace, then select **Windows Server**.

    {: .note }
    > Ensure that you select the resource published by `Microsoft`.

    ![Windows Server is highlighted within the Azure Marketplace search results.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-marketplace-windows-server.png "Windows Server is highlighted")

4. Choose **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition**, then select **Create**.

5. On the **Create a virtual machine** pane, set the following values to configure the new virtual machine:

    - **Resource group**: Select the resource group that you created for this lab. Such as `tailspin-rg`.
    - **Virtual machine name**: Give the VM a unique name, such as `tailspin-webapp-vm`.
    - **Region**: Select **North Central US**
    - **Image**: Verify the image is set to **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - x64 Gen 2**.

    ![The Create a virtual machine pane is shown with values entered and filed highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-machine-windows-server-image-set.png "Create a virtual machine with field set")

6. Set the **Size** field by selecting the **Standard_D4s_v5** virtual machine size.

    ![The Virtual Machine Size field is shown with the desired size selected.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-machine-size-set.png "VM size is set")

7. Set a **Username** and **Password** for the **Administrator account** for the VM.

    {: .important }
    > Be sure to save the Username and Password for the VM, so it can be used later. A recommendation for easy to remember data:
    >
    > - Username: `demouser`
    > - Password `demo!pass123`

    ![The Virtual Machine Administrator account field is shown with the values set.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-machine-account-set.png "Administrator account is set")

8. Select **Next** until you are navigated to the **Networking** tab of the **Create a virtual machine** page.

    ![The Networking tab of the Create a virtual machine pane is selected.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-machine-networking-tab-selected.png "Networking tab is selected")

9. Provision the VM in the Spoke VNet in Azure by selecting the following values under the **Network interface** section:

    - **Virtual network**: Select the Spoke VNet created for this lab. Its name will be similar to `tailspin-spoke-vnet`.
    - **Subnet**: `default`
    - **Public IP**: `None`

    ![The Networking tab has the Network interface values selected for the Virtual network, Subnet, and Public IP to connect to the VM.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-machine-networking-values-set.png "Virtual Network, Subnet, and Public IP values are set")

10. Set the following values to ensure that HTTPS traffic will be allowed to connect to the VM:

    - **NIC network security group**: `Basic`
    - **Public inbound ports**: `Allow selected ports`
    - **Select inbound ports**: `HTTPS (443)`

    ![The Public inbound ports field is set to Allow selected ports and the Select inbound ports has HTTPS 443 selected.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-network-https-traffic-allowed.png "Networking inbound ports set to allow HTTPS traffic")

11. Select **Review + create** to review the virtual machine settings.

    ![The Review + create button for the Create a virtual machine pane is shown and highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-network-review-create-button.png "Review + create button")

12. Select **Create** to begin provisioning the virtual machine once the **Validation passed** message is shown.

    ![The Validation passed message is shown and the Create button is highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/create-virtual-machine-create-button.png "Validation passed and Create button")
