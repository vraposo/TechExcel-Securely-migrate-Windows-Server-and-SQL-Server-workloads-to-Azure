1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the newly created **Virtual Machine**.

2. On the left, under the **Connect** section, select **Bastion**.

    > **Note**: The Azure Bastion instance named `tailspin-hub-bastion` was previously created with the Before the Hands-on lab setup. This is a required resource for using Azure Bastion to securely connect to Azure VMs using RDP from within the Azure Portal.

4. A new browser tab will open with Azure Bastion connected to the virtual machine over RDP. To close this session, you can close this browser tab.

    ![A browser window is shown open with Bastion connected to a remote desktop session to the VM.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/browser-azure-bastion-connected-web-app-win2022server.png "Browser window open with Azure Bastion connected to the VM")

> **Note**: Now that the Windows Server 2022 VM has been created in Azure, Tailspin Toys will now be able to modify their Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines within Azure DevOps to begin deploying the Web Application code to this virtual machine as they get ready for migrating the application to Azure.
