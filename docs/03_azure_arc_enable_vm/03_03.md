# Task 03 - Verify Azure Arc-enabled VM

## Introduction

Tailspin Toys wants to migrate their on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance. In this task, you will Verify that the Azure Arc-enabled VM has been added successfully.

## Description

In this task, you will Verify that the Azure Arc-enabled VM has been added successfully.

The key tasks are as follows:
1. Confirm that the **Machine - Azure Arc** pane for the on-premises virtual machine should shows the **Status** as **Connected**.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Resource Group for the lab.

    ![The tailspin-rg Resource group for the lab is shown in the Azure Portal.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-resource-group-tailspin-rg.png "tailspin-rg resource group")

2. Scroll down and locate the Azure resource of type **Machine - Azure Arc** and select it.

    {: .note }
    > The on-premises VM has been Azure Arc-enabled and can be managed alongside other Azure resources. This is enabled by the **Azure Connected Machine Agent** running on the VM that facilitates the interaction between Azure and the Azure Arc-enabled VM.

3. This is the **Machine - Azure Arc** pane for the on-premises virtual machine that was just Azure Arc-enabled. The **Status** shows **Connected** to signify that the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine is connected to Azure. Also, notice that the **Computer Name** and **Operating System** of the virtual machine are displayed.

4. From here, there are several **Azure Arc** capabilities available to use for managing the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine.

    ![The Capabilities section of the Machine - Azure Arc pane is shown with the list of capabilities to choose from.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-server-azure-arc-capabilities.png "Azure Arc capabilities listed on the Machine - Azure Arc pane")

5. Select **Extensions** under **Settings**. This is where you can install Extensions on the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine. For example, the **Custom Script Extension for Windows - Azure Arc** extension can be used to download PowerShell scripts and files from Azure storage and launch a PowerShell script on the machine.

    ![The Extensions pane for the Machine - Azure Arc resource is shown with the Extensions link under Settings highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-server-azure-arc-extensions.png "Azure Portal Machine - Azure Arc pane showing Extensions")
