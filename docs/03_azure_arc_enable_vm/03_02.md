# Task 02 - Run script to add server to Azure Arc

## Introduction

Tailspin Toys wants to migrate their on-premises SQL Server database to Azure SQL Managed Instance. In this task, you will run the script in the on-prem VM.

## Description

In this task, you will run the script in the on-prem VM.

The key tasks are as follows:
1. Run the script in the on-prem VM.
2. After the script, a message stating "**Connected machine to Azure**" will be shown.

## Success Criteria

* Successfully run the script.
* A message stating "**Connected machine to Azure**" will be shown after running the script.

## Solution

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Resource Group for the lab, then select the **`tailspin-onprem-hyperv-vm`** virtual machine resource. This is the simulated on-premises Hyper-V host VM.

    ![The resource group for the lab is shown with the simulated on-premises Hyper-V Host VM highlighted in the resource list.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-lab-rg-hyperv-vm.png "Resource group with simulated on-premises Hyper-V Host VM highlighted")

2. On the left, select **Bastion** under **Connect**.

    ![The virtual machine pane for the simulated on-premises hyper-v host VM is shown with the Bastion link under Operations highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-vm-connect-bastion-link.png "Bastion link under Operations")

3. Enter the **Username** and **Password**, then select **Connect**.

    {: .important }
    > When the VM was created the credentials were set up as:
    - **Username**: `demouser`
    - **Password**: `demo!pass123`

    ![The Bastion pane is shown for the VM with the Username and Password values entered and fields highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-vm-bastion-username-password-entered.png "Bastion credentials shown entered")

4. Once connected to the Hyper-V Host VM, open the **Start menu**, then search for and run the **Hyper-V Manager**.

5. Within the **Hyper-V Manager**, double-click the **OnPremVM** VM to connect to it.

    ![The Hyper-V Manager is shown with the list of virtual machines displayed with the OnPremVM highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/hyper-v-manager-vm-list.png "Hyper-V Manager list of VMs with OnPremVM shown")

6. Once connected to the **OnPremVM** VM within Hyper-V, sign in using the **Administrator** account and the password of `demo!pass123`.

    {: .note }
    > If you need to send a `Ctrl + Alt + Delete` command to the VM, under **Action**, select **Ctrl+Alt+Delete**.
    >
    > ![The CtrlAltDel action on the HyperV Manager with the option highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/hyper-v-action-keys.png "Ctrl+Alt+Delete Action")

    {: .warning }
    > If you encounter that the **OnPremVM** has **No Internet Connection**, go back into the `tailspin-onprem-hyperv-vm` Hyper-V Host VM and perform the following steps:
    > - Open the **View network connections**.
    > - Locate the **Ethernet** connection and right-click it.
    > - Select **Properties**.
    > - Select the **Sharing** tab.
    > - Disable and re-enable **Internet Connection Sharing** on this connection.
    > - Select **OK**
    >
    > You may see a warning message when disabling it and re-enabling it, but it will still work to restore Internet Connection Sharing with the **OnPremVM** that is connected through the Host VM's network connection.
    >
    > ![The Ethernet connection properties on the Hyper-V Host VM showing Internet Connection Sharing option highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/windows-hyperv-network-connections-internet-connection-sharing.png "Ethernet Properties for Internet Connection Sharing")
    >
    > Go back into the **OnPremVM** and perform the following steps:
    > - Open **Windows PowerShell**
    > - Execute command: `ipconfig /flushdns`

7. Within the **OnPremVM**, open the **Windows PowerShell ISE**, and create a new script file.

8. Paste in the contents of the Azure Arc `OnboardingScript.ps1` script previously downloaded.

    {: .note }
    > Within the Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection window, you may need to use the **Clipboard** -> **Type clipboard text** menu option to paste into the **OnPremVM**.

9. Run the full script. This will install the Azure Arc agent and Arc-enable the VM. When the script opens a browser window, enter your credentials to authenticate with Azure.

    {: .note }
    > When the Azure Arc script opens a new browser window to authenticate you with Azure, be sure to use an Organization Account with permissions to create `Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines` resources. Using a Personal Account is not supported and will result in a `AZCM0042: Failed to Create Resource` error message.

10. When the script finishes executing successfully, a message stating "**Connected machine to Azure**" will be shown, along with the Azure Portal resource URL for the Azure Arc-enabled Server.

    ![The command line output of the Azure Arc script is shown that includes the Connected machine to Azure message showing the script executed successfully.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-enabled-script-successful.png "Azure Arc script successful with Connected machine to Azure message")
